01:02:06,404 --> 01:02:09,181
In this lesson, we're going to
be talking about finance. And

2
01:02:09,181 --> 01:02:13,013
one of the most important aspects
of finance is interest.

3
01:02:13,013 --> 01:02:16,659
When I go to a bank or some
other lending institution

4
01:02:16,659 --> 01:02:20,724
to borrow money, the bank is happy
to give me that money. But then I'm

5
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:24,484
going to be paying the bank for the
privilege of using their money. And that

6
01:02:24,664 --> 01:02:29,444
amount of money that I pay the bank is
called interest. Likewise, if I put money

7
01:02:29,624 --> 01:02:34,224
in a savings account or I purchase a
certificate of deposit, the bank just

8
01:02:34,304 --> 01:02:38,804
doesn't put my money in a little box
and leave it there until later. They take

9
01:02:38,804 --> 01:02:43,826
my money and lend it to someone
else. So they are using my money.

10
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:47,404
The bank has to pay me for the privilege
of using my money.

11
01:02:47,404 --> 01:02:51,704
Now what makes banks
profitable is the rate

12
01:02:51,704 --> 01:02:56,334
that they charge people to use the bank's
money is higher than the rate that they

13
01:02:56,514 --> 01:03:03,724
pay people like me to use my money. The
amount of interest that a person pays or

14
01:03:03,804 --> 01:03:09,644
earns is dependent on three things. It's
dependent on how much money is involved.

15
01:03:09,824 --> 01:03:14,304
It's dependent upon the rate of interest
being paid or the rate of interest being

16
01:03:14,484 --> 01:03:20,902
charged. And it's also dependent upon
how much time is involved. If I have

17
01:03:20,902 --> 01:03:25,734
a loan and I want to decrease the amount
of interest that I'm going to pay, then

18
01:03:25,804 --> 01:03:31,044
I'm either going to have to decrease how
much money I borrow, I'm going to have

19
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:35,424
to borrow the money over a shorter period
of time, or I'm going to have to find a

20
01:03:35,604 --> 01:03:40,283
lending institution that charges a lower
interest rate. On the other hand, if I

21
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:44,484
want to earn more interest on my
investment, I'm going to have to invest

22
01:03:44,484 --> 01:03:49,864
more money, leave the money in the
account for a longer period of time, or

23
01:03:49,864 --> 01:03:52,974
find an institution that will pay
me a higher interest rate.
